**A practical and project-based repository for mastering modern React development from core concepts to advanced patterns.**

This repository is designed for developers who understand JavaScript fundamentals and are ready to dive into building user interfaces with React. It provides a structured learning path with clear examples, mini-projects, and explanations that cover everything from the basic building blocks to state-of-the-art practices used in production applications.

## üìö What You Will Learn Here

This collection is organized to guide you from zero to proficiency in React. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown of the concepts covered:

### 1. **The React Foundation**
    - **Creating Your First React App** (with `Create React App` / `Vite`)
    - Understanding the Project Structure
    - **JSX** Syntax and Rules
    - **Components**: The Building Blocks (Functional vs. Class)
    - **Props**: Passing Data to Components
    - Composing Components

### 2. **Interactivity and State Management**
    - **Introducing State** with the `useState` Hook
    - Handling User Events (onClick, onChange, onSubmit)
    - **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components** (Forms and Inputs)
    - **Lifting State Up** for shared data between components
    - **The `useReducer` Hook** for complex state logic

### 3. **Side Effects and Data Fetching**
    - The **`useEffect` Hook** in-depth
    - Fetching Data from an API (`fetch`, `axios`)
    - Working with dependencies and cleanup functions
    - Using `async/await` inside `useEffect`

### 4. **Performance and Advanced Hooks**
    - The **`useRef` Hook** for accessing DOM elements and storing mutable values
    - The **`useCallback` Hook** to memoize functions
    - The **`useMemo` Hook** to memoize expensive calculations
    - The **`React.memo`** Higher-Order Component to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### 5. **Context API for Global State**
    - **`createContext`** and the **`useContext` Hook**
    - Avoiding Prop Drilling
    - Building a Light/Dark Theme Toggler as a practical example

### 6. **Custom Hooks**
    - Creating your own **Custom Hooks** to reuse stateful logic
    - Examples: `useFetch`, `useLocalStorage`, `useToggle`

### 7. **Routing with React Router**
    - Setting up **React Router** for a Multi-Page Experience
    - **`BrowserRouter`**, **`Routes`**, **`Route`**, and **`Link`**
    - Dynamic Routing with URL Parameters
    - The `useNavigate` and `useParams` hooks

### 8. **Advanced Patterns and Concepts**
    - **Composition** vs. Inheritance (Using the `children` prop and other patterns)
    - **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**
    - **Render Props** Pattern

## üéØ How This Repository Will Help You

*   **From Basics to Advanced:** The topics are organized to build your knowledge progressively, ensuring you understand each concept before moving to the next.
*   **Learn by Doing:** Concepts are demonstrated through small, focused examples and mini-projects (like a Theme Toggler, a Todo App, or a Crypto Tracker) that you can build and experiment with.
*   **Modern Practices:** This repo focuses exclusively on modern React using Functional Components and Hooks, which is the current standard for writing React applications.
*   **Foundation for Real-World Apps:** Mastering these topics provides the essential foundation needed to build robust applications and learn related technologies like Next.js, state management libraries (Redux, Zustand), and testing.

## üõ† Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/riteg21/learning-react.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd learning-react
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies for a specific project:**
    Each project or example folder may be self-contained. Navigate into one and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or if using Vite
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in your terminal).
